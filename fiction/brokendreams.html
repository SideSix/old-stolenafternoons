      <article>
          <p><span class="initcap">I</span>t had been raining for five days; one of those slow, steady rains, a "farmer's rain" as Rachel's grandmother would have said...rain that is slow enough to soak the ground and nourish the crops. At least until it falls for too long and it starts to drown everything it touches.  That's what this rain had become, a "drowning rain," and it made the old carnival grounds look particularly bleak as she crept past, part of the sea of red tail-lights that spread out in front of her. </p>
          <p>She didn't often come this way, but with the rain, traffic was beyond snarled on Route Three, and most of the other ways home were flooded.  So almost everyone who wasn't somewhere else was creeping along Old Oak Road past the abandoned carnival grounds, their wipers beating back and forth slowly like an old dog's tail.</p> 
          <p>The grounds had sunk into inevitable disrepair over the last twenty-five years and all that remained was a part of the picket fence that used to ring the carousel, the old ticket booth where Karl used to smile at her, and most of the carousel, itself. Over the years kids had taken most of the carousel ponies. What were left were slick with the relentless rain and reflecting light in a sad way only carousel ponies could. One of the ponies, still attached to its pole, was leaning up against the picket fence as if it had crashed into it somehow; or maybe it was just tired and had laid down there to die soaking wet in the rain.</p>
          <p>Rachel had never liked being wet, not even as a young woman, because it was uncomfortable and not her idea. She didn't mind winter because then the rain was snow and it was easy to brush off.  Snow didn't soak clean through to the bones.  Being wet was a state of mind and it was okay if you planned it — as in taking shower or going skinny dipping down at Miller Creek Pond. </p> 
           <p>Rachel always wondered why they called it "Miller Creek Pond" because there wasn't a creek; it was just an old iron ore mine that had filled up with ground water. It was a great place to go skinny dipping on those hot, humid, Summer nights when the crickets made the air throb and the temperature was 98 degrees at 2:30 in the morning. Those hot nights when you lied there naked with nothing over you; where you lied there perfectly still, sweating. When you lied there and wondered why they stole this land from the Indians in the first place. When you lied there naked and hoped to God no one would touch you.</p> 
           <p>The water in Miller Creek Pond was always cold, and it tasted rusty, but it was refreshing on the hot, humid nights, and Rachel didn't even mind being soaking wet and sitting on the boulders that lined the shore on those hot humid nights. Her Uncle Roy had been the first one to take her to Miller Creek Pond. She tried to remember when that might be, as she sat stalled in the traffic on Old Oak Road, staring at that sad empty ticket booth where Karl used to stand. She figured she must have been about 12...maybe 13...just developing...embarrassed by her pubic hair. What bothered Rachel about the rain was the sudden, unplanned part of being soaked through. It was exactly what happen every time she saw Karl.</p>  
            <p>The thing about Karl was his eyes. Well sort of anyway. It was his eyes and his smile. He had one of those smiles that Rachel knew would have made her grandmother "drop her drawers." There was a light to his smile that shone through his broken, brown eyes. There was mischief; the type where no-one gets hurts — the type of "bad boy" all girls want, and some can't avoid. And, there was the way Karl smelled of diesel fuel and caramel corn.</p>  
             <p>Karl worked the carnival whenever it came to town. In particular, Karl worked the merry-go-round because there wasn't a chance in hell anyone would get hurt. All he had to do was make sure to keep the engine filled with diesel fuel and to smile. The men who ran the carnival weren't fools; they had seen Karl's smile and they knew exactly how it would make every mother's eyes smile insanely as she forked over every dollar she had to keep her kid on those poorly, painted wooden ponies that went nowhere.</p> 
             <p>Rachel was young and single. She loved carnivals, but wasn't sure why. Probably it was the lights at night. And the smell of the straw mixed in with the hard-pack clay. During the day, when the relentlessly blue sky shone a clear light on everything, the carnival had a cheapness that made Rachel's flesh feel oily. The carnival workers had all clearly done time. The tattoos and the dull glaze to their eyes said volumes about drug use, jail, rum and cocaine. But at night, when the people from town were hyped, off work, and full of something that screamed "give me fun," it was different. The lights almost had a halo, as if blessed by God, Himself. They twinkled. They promised...something.</p> 
              <p>And it was that vague promise that sung like a Siren to her as she smiled into Karl's eyes and handed him her ticket. It was a Tuesday night and warm for that time of year. Usually Rachel sat on one of those wooden benches that looked like a church pew that only went around in a circle. The benches were spread out every so often behind a grouping of painted ponies and that is where the mothers sat.  At least the mothers who didn't have to stand next to the pony because her child was too young yet. Rachel didn't want to look odd and she figured that sitting on the bench made her look like just another mom.</p> 
             <p>But that Tuesday night, as Karl watched, she wanted to run to a pony like a young girl — one of those high school girls with clear eyes and no scars. Her jeans were just tight enough, she knew, and she wanted to run in order to feel that sense of abandon and joy. But she constrained herself to a walk and she almost went to her usual bench when she figured "screw it." There weren't that many people at the carnival being a Tuesday and all, so she headed to the most freshly painted pony she could find. It's mane was pitch-black, like a room without lights — like Bobby Tillman's bedroom back in high-school with it's black walls and posters lit by black lights.</p> 
             <p>The pony's saddle was a deep blue, like the Choir robes down at The First Assembly of God. It, the pony, was shiny, reflecting the carousel's lights, and that made her feel happy so she smiled as she swung her leg over the saddle.   Once she was settled she looked over at Karl. He was staring right at her, his lips parted slightly, as if he had just licked them and she figured she knew what he was thinking. </p>
             <p>The memory of last Saturday night made her blush; they hadn't even made it back to the car, but instead fell down into a tangle behind the first aid tent. Right there in the straw and the dirt she wriggled her jeans down and off of one leg. She had hardly ever kissed anyone in public, let alone made love mostly naked behind a faded yellow and blue striped tent. The smell of straw and canvas and Karl's sweat had been intoxicating.  It was only afterward that she realized Karl had actually been intoxicated, having nipped at a bottle while running the carousel.</p> 
             <p>The sticky smell of cotton candy enveloped her as she sat mounted and waiting for the ride to start. For about the 100th time she wondered what had caused her behavior behind the first aid tent.  It wasn't just his eyes and smile. She knew that much.  Maybe it was his kindness. He was always very kind to the kids, even leaving his post to help a kid up onto a pony sometimes.  But there wasn't anything creepy about it, like there was when her Uncle Roy helped a kid do anything. No, with Karl it was like the act of a servant. </p>
             <p>The wind started to blow slightly and she wiped some stray strands of hair from her eyes. The first aid tent, like most tents didn't go clean to the ground; there was a space and she had watched the peoples' feet as she and Karl went at it. That part of it thrilled her in a way that truly frightened her. It scared her more than her Uncle Roy or any of his men ever had.  It scared her because she liked it; best sex ever — forbidden and strange.</p> 
             <p>And afterward he had brushed some stray strands of hair away from her eyes with the gentleness one uses to caress an object that is priceless; one that can break, but isn't fragile, like Edgar Degas' sculpture "Small Dancer Aged 14". Karl brushed her hair away as if he was actually touching her soul.</p>  
             <p>Music, scratchy and distant, as if a memory, started and then Rachel's pony started to move up and down and slowly as the carousel went round and round and she held onto the pole, rather than the wore leather reins, just like a little kid, her feet swaying in and out under the pony softly, and as she came around, she would look for Karl; sometimes he was busy talking to a mother or a kid and sometimes he was just standing there smiling, waiting for her to spin into view...or so it seemed...he'd smile when she came around...she imagined his eyes were waving at her shyly, just like Bobby Tillman had waved to her at those mixers back in junior high school.</p> 
             <p>Wind blew in from the direction of the freeway and it was warm enough that Rachel had a small line of perspiration on her upper lip. Her arm pits were damp so she raised her arms up the pole so that they were exposed and she hoped the slight breeze and the motion of the carousel would dry them.</p>  
             <p>She was hungry and figured that after her ride, she'd wander down maybe to the beer garden for dinner, and get a hamburger and a cold mug of Amstel. If they had it on tap. Otherwise she'd order Miller Lite with the burger, and the steak fries. Or maybe she'd just stop and have a corn dog near the entrance to the midway. There were a few benches there and she could sit in the shadow of the big, Black Oaks eating her dinner and then be back down here to the carousel before Karl knew she was gone.  It was only Tuesday night, but who knew what sort of mom might wander up to give her kid a ride and end up taking a ride herself and ruining everything. </p>
             <p>Maybe she shouldn't have said anything about that to Uncle Roy.  Still Uncle Roy never did pay all that much attention to what she said. Not unless she was underneath him and then he really didn't seem to hear her. Not really.  Uncle Roy only heard and saw whatever he wanted to hear and see...that was Uncle Roy, her father's brother. Besides you never wanted to point out anything much to Uncle Roy. He had a "temper" as her mom used to say.</p>  
             <p>That is what Rachel was thinking as she wandered down the Midway to the entrance. She turned left and walked about 30 yards, thens she stopped in front of the "Astro Dogs" stand. A young couple was buying their dinner; he looked like someone who was trying to make his way in banking, while his date looked like she taught third grade. She liked the Astro Dog booth the best because they used real lard. She figured why not? If you're going to eat something like a corn dog, you might as well have it fried in lard; Rachel didn't understand the half-measures that most people took. "Why screw yourself" is the way she viewed it.</p>
             <p>The young couple finished up, and then she stepped right up to the deeply scarred counter and ordered one with a lemonade.  That's how she said it, "One with a lemonade," because all they sold were corn dogs.  She had her choice of ketchup or mustard and both were in one gallon pump jars near the end of the counter. Rachel had read somewhere that there were only three different kinds of seeds they grew mustard from.  And she knew that there were tons of different types of mustard for sale; probably as many different mustards as there are different types of people in the world. "Astro Dogs" only offered one kind of mustard; that yellow mustard that Uncle Roy put on his hot dogs every time they went to the ball park.  She she opted to go sans-mustard and just squirted some ketchup on her dog like a long thin trail of blood. </p>
             <p>She sat on the bench eating her corn dog and not really looking at anything in particular. She was just looking and seeing the way some people do when they eat; not really thinking about anything...just enjoying the meal.  She looked about ten feet out at the ground, watching the shoes go by, enjoying the sounds, and enjoying the taste of the fried corn meal. She saw a pair of tan work boots walk past that she'd know anywhere; the left one had a few drops of blue paint on the steel-reinforced toe. She had seen those boots many times, including last Saturday night. They had been inside the first aid tent and she had focused on them as her passion built. They were scuffed raw and belonged to Uncle Roy and he was walking fast with purpose; setting each foot down firmly like he did when his mind was made up. </p>
             <p>Without any thought she looked down at her corn dog. There was about half of it left. She wasn't really hungry anymore and then she had to move. She started to walk fast, and she tossed the rest of the corn dog into a trash bin as she went past and then she started to run and she didn't know why just that she should run as fast as she could and cry out. But she didn't know what to cry out so she ran silently as fast as she could, the air burning her lungs, unused to running and her eyes were starting to tear up and everything looked wet and jumpy. That's when she heard the shots.</p>
             <p>Three of them, fast, bam bam bam, and then all she heard was her blood pounding in her ears.  She stood still. In the middle of the midway's main aisle of fun, she couldn't move. She didn't want to go another step. Not ever. The few people around were looking down toward the carousel. It was a Tuesday night.</p>
            <p>Karl lay face-down, sprawled on the ground about ten feet from the ticket booth, as if he had been running toward the carousel to help a kid up onto a pony. There wasn't anyone else around and Rachel didn't have to get very close to know he was dead.  She didn't see that he was dead. She knew it. There's just something about a dead body; the person isn't there anymore and you don't need to be real close to know that much. He must have used his .45, army issue, because part of Karl's head was gone and the ground under him looked sodden. Rachel threw up. And then she started to cry.</p>
             <p>Twenty-five years later in her car, in the rain, what Rachel remembered the most distinctly was the deeply scarred counter at the Astro Dog stand. She could still see all the different ways people had gouged the counter with coins and knives and God knows what all. There had been initials and whatnot, modern hieroglyphics; she remembered running a quarter, part of her change, around inside of an "A" that had been inscribed inside of a circle. Funny what you remember. </p>
             <p>The cars started to move and then she was on her way home to a house without photographs of kids and the dogs would need to be fed, unless his pickup truck was in the driveway. Then she wouldn't need to bother with the dogs. She thought about maybe driving somewhere else. Maybe she'd drive to Kentucky.  She didn't know anyone there, but she heard that it was a very green place, with lots of life.</p>
